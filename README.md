I am S. Kailash Nath from Hyderabad. I completed my graduation in Data Science from Malla Reddy Engineering College in 2024.

I started my career with Wipro, where I worked as a Fraud Analyst for the client Google for 7 months. That role gave me valuable exposure to analytical thinking and real-time problem-solving. Currently, I am interning at Ramanasoft as a Data Science Engineer, where I am gaining hands-on experience in applying machine learning and data-driven solutions to real-world problems.

I have also worked on several academic and personal projects, including:

Weather Report Prediction

Spam Detection using Deep Convolutional Forest

Stock Market Analysis using XGBoost

Now, I am looking forward to advancing my career as an IT professional, where I can apply my skills in data science, machine learning, and problem-solving to contribute to organizational growth while continuing to learn and develop as a professional.
